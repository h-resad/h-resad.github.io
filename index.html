      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has emerged as a practical paradigm for industrial visual detection
        due to its low reliance on defect samples. Yet, existing benchmarks fail to capture two critical aspects 
        of precision manufacturing: the ultrasparse nature of submillimeter anomalies and the need for tolerance-aware 
        hierarchical annotation across functional zones. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-ResAD, the first industrial 
        anomaly detection dataset that jointly features 2048×2048 high-resolution tiles with an extremely low anomaly 
        proportion of 0.05%, together with hierarchical annotations reflecting zone-specific tolerances of metallic 
        bipolar plates. This design retains fine-grained defect details while realistically modeling the sparsity and 
        functional constraints of real-world detection. We systematically benchmark seven representative UAD methods, 
        two high-resolution frameworks (Tiled ensemble, HiAD), and five vision-language models (VLMs). Results show that 
        conventional UAD excels at image-level discrimination but struggles with pixel-level localization and regional 
        consistency. High-resolution frameworks substantially improve robustness, with HiAD particularly effective for 
        ultrasparse anomaly detection. VLMs demonstrate promising zero/few-shot adaptability but remain limited under 
        ultrasparse and hierarchical settings. Overall, H-ResAD establishes a challenging and realistic benchmark that 
        closes the gap between academic datasets and industrial demands. Beyond evaluation, it provides a unified platform 
        for future research into lightweight high-resolution architectures, tolerance-aware learning frameworks, and multimodal 
        anomaly detection systems.
